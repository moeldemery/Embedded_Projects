# Embedded Projects

A curated collection of embedded systems projects, examples and tooling collected by moeldemery. This repository contains demos, experiments, and small production-ready pieces for different microcontroller families, RTOS usage, networking (MQTT), and supporting tooling.

> NOTE: This README was generated by inspecting the repository's top-level structure. If you want me to commit this file to the repository, I can push it for you — tell me and I'll do the commit.

## Repository overview

Top-level directories:
- [ARM](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/ARM)  
  Examples and projects targeting ARM microcontrollers (C/C++, vendor HALs, likely STM/ARM Cortex examples).
- [AVR](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/AVR)  
  Projects for AVR-family MCUs (Atmega/Attiny) including bare-metal examples and small demos.
- [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/FreeRTOS)  
  FreeRTOS-based demos and examples demonstrating tasks, synchronization primitives, and peripherals.
- [OPCode Example](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/OPCode%20Example)  
  A small VM or opcode interpreter demo — useful for learning how instruction decoding and execution work.
- [compiler](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/compiler)  
  Experimental compiler/toolchain code, transpilers, or assembler examples.
- [microwave](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/microwave)  
  An appliance-like embedded project (e.g., microwave controller demo) showing UI, state machines, and safety logic.
- [mqtt](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/mqtt)  
  MQTT client/server examples, likely showing how to integrate networked messaging on embedded devices.
- [tooling](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/tooling)  
  Build scripts, helper utilities, flashing/upload helpers, or dev automation.
- [upload](https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects/tree/main/upload)  
  Files, scripts, or assets intended to be uploaded to devices (firmware, binaries, or OTA helpers).

## Goals & audience

This repository is aimed at:
- Embedded developers learning microcontrollers and RTOS design.
- Hobbyists wanting reference projects for AVR/ARM development.
- Anyone interested in practical examples: peripheral drivers, concurrency with FreeRTOS, and lightweight networking (MQTT).

## Getting started (quick)

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/moeldemery/Embedded_Projects.git
2. Inspect the subfolder relevant to your platform (e.g., `ARM/`, `AVR/`, `FreeRTOS/`).
3. Read the README or notes inside each subfolder for build instructions and dependencies.

Each project typically requires:
- A cross-compiler (arm-none-eabi-gcc, avr-gcc, etc.)
- Vendor SDKs or HALs (STM32Cube, AVR-Libc, etc.)
- A flashing tool (openocd, avrdude, bossac) or the board's programming tool
- Optional: a serial terminal (picocom, minicom, PuTTY) for runtime logs

---

## Building & flashing (example workflow)

General pattern (customize per subproject):
- Enter the project folder:
  cd PATH/TO/PROJECT
- Read any project-specific README or Makefile comments.
- Build:
  make
  or
  ./build.sh
- Flash:
  make flash
  or
  openocd -f interface/your-debugger.cfg -f target/your-target.cfg ...
  or
  avrdude -p atmega328p -c usbasp -U flash:w:build/firmware.hex

If a project has CMake:
- mkdir build && cd build
- cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/toolchain.cmake
- make

---

## Conventions & tips

- Look for comments in `.c`, `.s`, and `.ld` files for target-specific configuration (memory layout, vector table).
- Peripherals often require enabling clocks and setting pinmux in vendor HALs — check the top of `main.c`.
- For FreeRTOS samples: increase stack sizes and configure tick frequency if needed (`FreeRTOSConfig.h`).

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Add or update a project README when introducing a new demo.
3. Provide build instructions, expected outputs, and how to test on real hardware or simulator.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and testing steps.

Guidelines:
- Keep examples minimal and focused (one main idea per project).
- Document any required external tools, SDKs, or hardware.
- Prefer reproducible builds (pin toolchain versions where possible).

---

## Roadmap / ideas

- Add CI builds using QEMU or unit tests (where applicable) to validate builds.
- Add a top-level index page per platform with status (build/test badges).
- Add wiring diagrams and board photos for hardware projects.

If you'd like, I can:
- Commit this README.md to the repository (I will need permission to push or you can accept a PR).
- Tailor the README with per-folder detailed build/flash commands by scanning each folder and extracting exact build steps — I can do that next.
